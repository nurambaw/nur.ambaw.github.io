		<p>My name is Nur Ambaw and I am 15 years old. I like to play basketball and video games as a hobby. I really enjoy meeting new people and make new friends. I feel that I am very observant and concious when it comes to some things. I grew up with my mother and brother as a kid and I am also the youngest out of my 4 total brothers (2 of them are half brothers). As the youngest, I really don't feel like I am spoiled and get what I want even though my brother keeps on reminding me I am. I feel I am very easy to talk to and hope to make new friends here at SMASH.	</p>

		<p>
			My favorite hobbies include playing basketball, playing video games, and overall just meeting new people. I hope that all my goals that I came here to achieve at SMASH come true. </p>
